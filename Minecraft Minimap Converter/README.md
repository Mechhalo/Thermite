# Minecraft Minimap Converter

This was developed by Darrick Ross for the purpose of converting minecraft
minimap mod file types. From REI Minimap format into Voxel Minimap format.
This was expressly built for the purpose of converting and combining
waypoints of different types into one. There are 4 levels of waypoints, each
layer has the same color, and "icon" but the rest is data from REI minimap
format.

This was tossed together on short notice, with zero intention to improve upon.


Example files in the 'Example Files' Folder were obtained from minezmap.com
